              I have begun to research my project&#8217;s first goal. I have already found the privacy policies and security settings of Google and some of Microsoft. All I have left now is the rest of Microsoft and Apple. Once I have finished this, I will have completed my first goal and will be ready to move on to my second. So far in my project, I have found difficulty in condensing the information to make it so that one would not be bored while reading this. I have decided that to be informative, yet simple, I will first write all the info that I can find and than make a seperate goal to make a summary version of the three companies and their information.

              I have finished the first goal on my project, and some of my second goal. The details for cyber attacks and the information stolen are not very informative, so I have taken the path of searching each attack separately once I find  them on the list. The articles I find of the attacks are then used to find specifics on the attacks themselves and also what was stolen from the companies. I will still have to finish the attacks on Apple and Microsoft, but Google seems to be good for now. Once I am done this, I will begin to condense the information into digestible pieces that are easier to present.

              I finished most of the attacks for all three companies, but I still have to go through all of them one more time just to make sure I didn&#8217;t miss anything. I have begun creation of my blog, which I plan to host on GitHub. The actual coding and styling of the site is already mostly done as I am reusing a site from an old project I worked on. I have also started reducing the information for each company into about a small paragraph in length each. My next goal is to finish the site and have it fully running.

            <p>

              The site is working with most of my information on it. I have to still properly format it all to make it look presentable but it is mostly done ignoring that fact. The summaries of each company are also mostly done, I just have to add some more detail to them. Overall, I think I&#8217;ve done quite a lot on the site and might just leave it as it is for now. My next goal is to move the site to GitHub and have it fully online by the next journal entry.

              All the information is now basically complete, except the summaries as they don&#8217;t fully showcase what the information I found is. My last goals will most likely be to:</br>
              i. <strike> Finish the summaries </strike> </br>
              ii. Create a speech to present my site</br>
              iii. <strike> Complete the information for Apple </strike> </br>
              iv. <strike> Make sure everything is correct and all my sources are cited. </strike>

                <b> How did I decide my theme? </b>
                <ul>
                  <li> I chose my theme after the recent laws that have been proposed in multiple areas of the world recently. Events such as the passing of Article 13 and the destruction of net neutrality had been on mind for a while, so that aided in my inspiration to use this theme. I used these influences and thought about a broader picture, which to me was <i>How much of ourselves do we still own?</i>. </li>
                </ul>

                <b> How did I choose my area? </b>
                <ul>
                  <li> My entire project is pretty set on being based on the web and online activities, so the clear choice to present these findings was New Media. </li>
                </ul>

                <b> How did I choose the form to express my area? </b>
                <ul>
                  <li> I chose to use a blog in particular because I have some experience in certain aspects of web creation and design, so a blog/site seemed to be the best way to utilize my limited skill. </li>
                </ul>

                <b> How did I address difficulties? </b>
                <ul>
                  <li> Anytime I had a problem like, for example, when I had a problem creating my site, I slowed down and backed up from what I&#8217;m trying to do. I would than slowly go through the problem step by step until I found the specific part or location of the problem, and then correct it. </li>
                </ul>

                <b> What did I learn through the process? </b>
                <ul>
                  <li> During this project, I learned the difficulties of just searching for information and copying down what I saw, because that wasn&#8217;t enough for what I was trying to showcase. I had to dive deeper into actual articles of individual events that I was trying to research, like the references of wikipedia pages and the articles that they linked to. </li>
                </ul>

                <b> What did I accomplish? </b>
                <ul>
                  <li> I accomplished quite a bit during this project. For starters, I was able to research something I chose by myself to finish a project I created for myself. This is something new to me, as I would normally just be given a topic for a certain project when required to do so. Another thing I accomplished was the creation of fully functioning site with a purpose. I have practiced creating sites in the past, but this is the first time I&#8217;ve created a site with a purpose from the ground up (mostly).  </li>
                </ul>

                <b> Where will this work be heading in grade 11? </b>
                <ul>
                  <li> I don&#8217;t know, but I hope to continue with New Media for the rest of my highschool years enthusiastically. I&#8217;m not sure about continuing this theme I have created for myself, however, as I&#8217;m not so sure I liked to research it as much as I could with other topics. </li>
                </ul>

                <b> Any final thoughts? </b>
                <ul>
                  <li> I would just like to state that did enjoy this project very much, though it was very tough to grasp the concept during the beginning phases, and it still is every now and then. I would definitely be content with having to carry out this type of research project in the future and get the opportunity to do a much better job than I have currently have, not that I think I&#8217;ve done a bad job but just that I think I could have done better. </li>
                </ul>
