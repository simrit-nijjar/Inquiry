              I have begun to research my project’s first goal. I have already found the privacy policies and security settings of Google and some of Microsoft. All I have left now is the rest of Microsoft and Apple. Once I have finished this, I will have completed my first goal and will be ready to move on to my second. So far in my project, I have found difficulty in condensing the information to make it so that one would not be bored while reading this. I have decided that to be informative, yet simple, I will first write all the info that I can find and than make a seperate goal to make a summary version of the three companies and their information.

              I have finished the first goal on my project, and some of my second goal. The details for cyber attacks and the information stolen are not very informative, so I have taken the path of searching each attack separately once I find  them on the list. The articles I find of the attacks are then used to find specifics on the attacks themselves and also what was stolen from the companies. I will still have to finish the attacks on Apple and Microsoft, but Google seems to be good for now. Once I am done this, I will begin to condense the information into digestible pieces that are easier to present.

              I finished most of the attacks for all three companies, but I still have to go through all of them one more time just to make sure I didn’t miss anything. I have begun creation of my blog, which I plan to host on GitHub. The actual coding and styling of the site is already mostly done as I am reusing a site from an old project I worked on. I have also started reducing the information for each company into about a small paragraph in length each. My next goal is to finish the site and have it fully running.

              The site is working with most of my information on it. I have to still properly format it all to make it look presentable but it is mostly done ignoring that fact. The summaries of each company are also mostly done, I just have to add some more detail to them. Overall, I think I’ve done quite a lot on the site and might just leave it as it is for now. My next goal is to move the site to GitHub and have it fully online by the next journal entry.

              All the information is now basically complete, except the summaries as they don’t fully showcase what the information I found is. My last goals will most likely be to:</br> i. Finish the summaries</br> ii. Create a speech to present my site</br> iii. Complete the information for Apple</br> iv. Make sure everything is correct and all my sources are cited.
