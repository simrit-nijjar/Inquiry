              <h2> Google: </h2>
              Google has given away people&#8217;s information many time, be it willingly or unwillingly. Your information is usually collected automatically by them, unless you clearly state &#8217;no&#8217; on their privacy settings. They have released many user&#8217;s information via hacks that were committed towards them and even have let some the exploits used by the hackers to stay on their platform   for large periods of time. They also collect your device identifiers to keep track of all your online activities to &ldquo;personalize&rdquo; your experience. Though they currently seem untrustworthy, they do have systems set up to find exploits towards their security using a method of rewarding those that help expose them. You should be able to trust Google as long as you dive through their security options and clearly state what information you want to share with them, but I would be wary as to how much I rely on them for my daily tasks.

              <h2> Microsoft: </h2>
              Microsoft has their fare share of hacks directed towards them, but they usually only ever took information directly correlating with Microsoft&#8217;s intellectual data. They have also had a bad history with the security of Internet Explorer which has allowed users using it to have their data compromised by fraudulent sites that took advantage of the unsafe browser. They have since fixed all their old vulnerabilities and have even assisted in blocking attacks on other sites and companies. Microsoft doesn&#8217;t collect data as heavily as other companies such as google, while also having strong security to stop your information from being taken without consent.

              <h2> Apple: </h2>
              Apple is only given the information you make available to it. The data they collect from you varies from personal and non-personal informations. Your personal information will stay private, but your non-personal information can be used as Apple pleases. If in any situation your personal and non-personal information is combined, the non-personal information will be considered personal and will be kept private.  In their privacy policy, it is made clear that they only allow third parties to be given your information if you yourself give clear consent. Though they have had some small data breaches, these events were mostly closed off to a small percentage of their user base and was dealt with immediately. For the most part, you can trust Apple in holding your information.
