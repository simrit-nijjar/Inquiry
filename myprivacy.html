<h2> Microsoft: </h2>

1. <b> Browsing History: </b> </br>
If browsing history in Cortana is turned on, your Microsoft Edge browsing history is sent to Microsoft so that Microsoft features and services may use this data to provide you with timely and intelligent answers, proactive personalized suggestions, or to complete tasks for you. </br>
 </br>
2. <b> Search History: </b> </br>

 </br>
3. <b> Location Activity: </b> </br>
To give you directions to the places you want to go, and show you data relevant to where you are, we use locations that you provide or that we've detected using technologies like GPS. </br>
 </br>
4. <b> Voice Activity: </b> </br>
When you use voice commands with Windows, Cortana, and other cloud-based, voice-enabled products and services from Microsoft, we will collect and store your audio recordings so that we can enhance your experience with better speech recognition and other personalized speech experiences.

8. <b> Cortana's Notebook: </b> </br>
To help you avoid traffic, remember anniversaries, text the right “Jennifer” in your contact list, and in general do more, Cortana needs to know what you’re interested in, what’s on your calendar, and who you might want to do things with. The Notebook is where Cortana keeps track of your interests to give you a personalized experience. When you don’t want to reach for a keyboard, Cortana can use your speech and to help translate what you say or write into documents and text messages. </br>
 </br>
9. <b> LinkedIn: </b> </br>
When you connect your Microsoft and LinkedIn accounts, Microsoft shares some of your account data with LinkedIn, such as calendar and contact data. Likewise, LinkedIn shares some of your account data with Microsoft, such as profile and connections data. </br>
